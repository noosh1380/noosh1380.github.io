I'm an undergraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. I am also a researcher at Mila - Quebec AI Institute, working in Dr. Siva Reddyâ€™s NLP lab. Alongside my studies, I have been woking at Apple for over three years, currently holding the position of Technical Expert.

My research interests focus on using artificial intelligence to enhance accessibility. During my time at Marianopolis College in the Honours Pure and Applied Science Program, I conducted a literature review on the use of AI in prosthetics. I am now investigating the limitations of common vision-to-language mappings in vision-language models (VLMs). These projects have laid the groundwork for my ultimate research interest: Machine Learning in Sign Language Processing.

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, reading, and going to the gym. Fun fact: I have been playing piano for over 15 years and passed the McGill Conservatory Collegial Level Piano exams!
