I’m a computer scientist with a strong focus on machine learning and natural language processing. I’ve led research projects at Mila – Quebec AI Institute and McGill University, working on multimodal model benchmarking, performance pipelines, and vision-language model analysis. With top academic performance in ML, AI, NLP, and reinforcement learning, and hands-on experience collaborating with researchers at all levels, I’m passionate about applying machine learning to complex, real-world problems.
