A literature review on  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j6NFmLGffXBUjS2TV7wPXmjuTqS55IOc/view?usp=share_link">Use of Artificial Intelligence in Prosthetics</a> conducted at Marianopolis College as part of the honors program.


<h5><b>Abstractor</b></h5>

In everyday life, the word artificial intelligence has a futuristic connotation. Some people regard machine learning as a business opportunity while others treat the smart robots as a threat to mankind's superiority, intelligence, and independence. Regardless of societyâ€™s opinion toward artificial intelligence, scientists constantly attempt to develop and expand this new less-explored branch of computer science. In their perspective,artificial intelligence is not only an abstract idea but a tool that can be developed to be applied in near future for the purpose of compensating for any task where humans lack capability, such as creating more intuitive prostheses capable of replacing amputated limbs. This literature review explains the concept of artificial intelligence, the physiological process of moving a limb as well as the way in which the artificially intelligent prosthetic devices fully function as a biological limb.
